# devevolved/feedback

This is a quick little ask-me-anything (ama) type of repository.

It's a blatant rip-off of [scottdorman/feedback](https://github.com/scottdorman/feedback), which is itself a blantant rip-off of [haacked/feedback](https://github.com/haacked/feedback), which is itself a blatant rip-off of [holman/ama](https://github.com/holman/ama). But good ideas are meant to be spread.

If you have a comment or an issue on a specific blog post, please use [that repository](https://github.com/devevolved/devevolved.github.io/issues/new) instead.

If you have any other questions about any of those topics or me, feel free to ask it here.

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as [creating a new issue](https://github.com/devevolved/feedback/issues/new) on this repository.

Someone will try to answer it as soon as we can get to it. Once answered, we'll close the issue just so we know what's been covered, but don't worry - if you have any further questions just respond in the thread and we'll get back to you soon. Feel free to ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.
